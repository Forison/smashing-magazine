# Design Tear Down

Using one of [smashing magazine's website](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) as a case study, this project is about showing visual hierachy in terms of heatmap and showing how that and typography can affect web designs.

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
